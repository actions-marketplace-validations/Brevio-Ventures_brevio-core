"""Count how often each rule of ``brevio-core scan`` fires on pinned open-source repos, and how often it is right.

Reads ``tools/precision_corpus.json`` (popular TypeScript and React repositories, each pinned to a full commit SHA),
fetches each one shallowly at its SHA into a cache folder outside this repository, checks its licence file and runs the
scanner on it under ``python -I``, so the repository's own files cannot load code into it. It writes
``precision.json`` (hits per rule and per repository, files and lines scanned), a seeded sample of up to ``SAMPLE``
hits per rule (``precision_sample.jsonl``) and the page ``precision.md``, which is rendered from the JSON only, so it holds no
number typed by hand.

The sample quotes none of the third-party code it was drawn from (owner decision, 2026-11-13). An entry holds the repository,
its commit, the path, the line, the rule, the verdict and its reason, and ``line_sha256``: the hash of the line as the run read
it (``line_digest``). The lines around a hit, which a person needs to judge it, go to ``precision_to_judge.jsonl`` beside the
results; that file is a working copy, not part of a release, and a new run writes it for the hits still to judge.

A person judges each sampled hit: ``verdict`` is ``tp`` (the rule is right) or ``fp`` (it is not), with a one-line
``reason``. A re-run keeps each verdict whose hit is still sampled, matched by its ``id`` and by the hash of its line, read
again from the clone: a verdict given to other text is not kept. ``--rejudge`` only
recomputes the figures and the page from the judged sample. ``--record-before`` keeps the current figures and judged
sample (``precision_sample_before.jsonl``) as the "before" of a rule change, so the page shows both.

Anyone can run it again (improvement plan 2a, 2026-11-12). The file is standard library only and ships in the public
tree with the corpus and the judged results in ``docs/``. The scanner is the tree the file sits in, or the folder
``--scanner`` names. ``--seed DIR`` starts a run in a new ``--out`` folder from the judged results in ``DIR``, so the
committed ones stay as they are. The run needs the network to clone the corpus; the scan itself reads local files.
