"""What the ``brevio-core`` command line says about itself: its version, the rule list and the notes around a scan (2026-11-13).

``core_cli`` is over its size limit and may not grow, so the small pieces of the command-line surface live here: ``--version``,
the ``rules`` and ``explain`` text with the note on which rules ``scan`` runs, the hint that names ``scan --fix``, the warning
for a ``select`` that names no rule the scanner checks, and the guard that ends a command quietly when the reader of a pipe
has gone. Standard library and the rule catalogue only, so it ships in every set.
